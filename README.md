# Project666 ( A Virtual Assisstant )

  PROJECT_666 is a voice assistant based on AI, that uses voice recognition, 
  and voice synthesis to listen to specific voice commands and return relevant 
  information or perform specific functions as requested by the user. 
  Based on specific commands, sometimes called intents, spoken by the user, it 
  can return relevant information by listening for specific keywords and filtering 
  out the ambient noise.
